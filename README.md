Information Retrieval project

In this project, we'll create a search engine to retrieve text documents based on user queries. The project has two phases. In the first phase, we'll preprocess the documents, build an inverted index, and respond to user queries. In the second phase, we'll represent the documents as numerical vectors to improve the ranking process and search speed. We'll use suitable similarity metrics to rank the results based on their relevance to the user's query. Throughout the project, we'll analyze the effectiveness of different techniques and provide detailed reports on the system's performance.
